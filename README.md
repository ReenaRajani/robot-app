# Robot Challenge

## Description

- The application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop, of dimensions 5 units x 5 units.
- There are no other obstructions on the table surface.
- The robot is free to roam around the surface of the table, but must be prevented from falling to destruction. Any movement
  that would result in the robot falling from the table must be prevented, however further valid movement commands must still
  be allowed.

Create an application that can read in commands of the following form:

```plain
PLACE X,Y,F
MOVE
LEFT
RIGHT
REPORT
MOVE
REPORT
```

- PLACE will put the toy robot on the table in position X,Y and facing NORTH, SOUTH, EAST or WEST.
- The origin (0,0) can be considered to be the SOUTH WEST most corner.
- The first valid command to the robot is a PLACE command, after that, any sequence of commands may be issued, in any order, including another PLACE command. The application should discard all commands in the sequence until a valid PLACE command has been executed.
- MOVE will move the toy robot one unit forward in the direction it is currently facing.
- LEFT and RIGHT will rotate the robot 90 degrees in the specified direction without changing the position of the robot.
- REPORT will announce the X,Y and orientation of the robot.
- A robot that is not on the table can choose to ignore the MOVE, LEFT, RIGHT and REPORT commands.
- The application must not exit after the first REPORT command, i.e. many REPORT commands can be received per session.
- It is up to you how you exit the application (e.g. exit command, Ctrl-C etc.)
- Provide test data to exercise the application.

## Constraints

The toy robot must not fall off the table during movement. This also includes the initial placement of the toy robot.
Any move that would cause the robot to fall must be ignored.

Example Input and Output:

```plain
PLACE 0,0,NORTH
MOVE
REPORT
Output: 0,1,NORTH
```

```plain
PLACE 0,0,NORTH
LEFT
REPORT
Output: 0,0,WEST
```

```plain
PLACE 1,2,EAST
MOVE
MOVE
LEFT
MOVE
REPORT
Output: 3,3,NORTH
```

## Project Specifications 

### Running the project 
  The application is developed using Node v20.3 and typescript and uses `yarn` as package manager. Tests are written in `jest`.
  The following commands are used to set up and run the application.

```shell
$ yarn
$ yarn build
$ yarn start
$ yarn test
```

**For development**, 

```shell
$ yarn start:dev 
$ yarn test:watch
```

### What the application supports
  Once you run the application using ``yarn start``, you will find the command prompt asking to enter the command. The commands are case insensitive and can accept both lowercase and uppercase letters.
  Valid commands are listed as above. Anything added other than those, would result in an invalid error message. 
  You can exit the application either using EXIT or using the keyboard CTRL+C.

### Limitations and refactor notes
 - currently only commands from the CLI are supported.It does not support commands from files.
 - Provided the setup for Docker, but they are still work in progress
